		This blog is my open notebook—a place where fitness goals meet personal stories, where ideas are captured before they drift away, and where curiosity is free to roam.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here, you’ll find a mix of the physical and the mental: my experiences in the gym and on the road toward better health, moments and memories that shaped me, and the systems I use to stay organized—whether it’s through a well-worn traveler’s notebook, a commonplace book brimming with quotes and reflections, or the digital tools that keep life moving.
	</p>
	<p>
	I’ll also be sharing technical posts drawn from my work in the world of DevOps and beyond, because creativity isn’t just for art—it’s for code, servers, and problem-solving too.
	</p>
	<p>
	Think of this space as part training log, part memoir, part field guide. My hope is that you’ll not only learn something here but also feel inspired to build your own systems, chase your own goals, and document the journey along the way.
	</p>
	<p>
	The path forward is always under construction. Let’s take it one step—one story—at a time.
